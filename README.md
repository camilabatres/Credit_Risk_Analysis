# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Purpose 
I oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Lastly, I used two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 


## Results 
* Naive Random Oversampling

Above, we have a 64.22% accuracy score, 1% precision high risk, 100% precision low risk, 63% recall high-risk, and 65% recall low-risk. 

* SMOTE Oversampling

Above, we have a 63.83% accuracy score, 1% precision high risk, 100% precision low risk, 64% recall high-risk, and 63% recall low-risk. Although SMOTE reduces the risk of oversampling, it does not always outperform random oversampling.

* Undersampling

Above, we have a 57.50% accuracy score, 1% precision high risk, 100% precision low risk, 64% recall high-risk, and 51% recall low-risk. 

* Combination

Above, we have a 64.85% accuracy score, 1% precision high risk, 100% precision low risk, 72% recall high-risk, and 57% recall low-risk.

## Summary 
In the first four models, the accuracy score is not as high as the ensemble scores.I would recommend one of the 2 ensemble models because the best predictive models have recall and precision accuracy.
